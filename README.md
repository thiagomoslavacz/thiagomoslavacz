### Hey There! 🤘

**`Front End Enginner`**

I'm Thiago, a developer focused on building clean, functional, and well-structured web interfaces.

I turn ideas into real, usable products through continuous iteration. My process is hands-on and practical: breaking things, building solutions, testing ideas, and adjusting until the result is solid, efficient, and clear. I’m constantly improving with personal and freelance projects, studying software engineering and modern front-end development, and refining both code quality and project structure.

Outside of code, I enjoy rock music and playing guitar 🎸, where practice and repetition are part of getting better over time.
